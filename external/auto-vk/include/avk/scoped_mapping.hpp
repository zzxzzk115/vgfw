	/**	Helper class that can be used with avk::mem_handle's or avk::vma_handle's
	 *	memory mapping functionality. It is advisable to use this class instead of
	 *	calling their ::map_memory and ::unmap_memory member functions directly,
	 *	because this class provides more safety: It ensures that ::unmap_memory
	 *	is invoked under all circumstances and also that the call to ::unmap_memory
	 *	is not forgotten since it must be ensured that for each ::map_memory call,
	 *	also an ::unmap_memory call is issued.
	 *
	 *	Usage example:
	 *
	 *	// Invoke ::map_memory on mBuffer, express the intent to read from it:
	 *	auto mapped = scoped_mapping{mBuffer, mapping_access::read};
	 *	// Copy 10 byte from the mapped memory (at address 'mapped.get()' to aDataPtr:
	 *	memcpy(aDataPtr, mapped.get(), 10);
	 *	// The destructor of 'mapped' will invoke ::unmap_memory.
